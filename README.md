## About The Project


This project involves developing a <b>credit scoring</b> tool for the financial company "Prêt à dépenser" that offers consumer loans for individuals with little or no loan history.<br>

The scoring tool must calculate the <b>probability that a customer will repay their loan</b> and <b>classify</b> the application as <b>approved</b> or <b>denied</b>.

The company also wants to develop an <b>interactive dashboard</b> for customer relationship managers to <b>transparently explain credit approval decisions</b> and enable customers to easily access and explore their personal information.
